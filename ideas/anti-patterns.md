# Phase 7: Negative Examples & Anti-patterns (Priority 2)

## 20. Document what NOT to do

- Add "Anti-patterns" sections to:
  - `.ai/agents/architect.md`: Bad plan examples (vague, over-scoped)
  - `.ai/agents/builder.md`: Scope creep examples
  - `.ai/agents/inspector.md`: Missed gate violations

## 21. Create anti-pattern catalog

- Add `.ai/docs/patterns/anti-patterns.md` covering:
  - Monolithic context files
  - Vague verification steps
  - Implementation without plans
  - Scope creep during execution
  - Ignoring established patterns
