# Overlay: value

Purpose:
- Keep work aligned to user and business value.
- Prioritize outcomes over implementation detail.

When to apply:
- Feature requests, prioritization trade-offs, and scope decisions.
- Plan reviews where scope may drift beyond the core objective.

Output focus:
- Clear value statement tied to an identifiable user problem.
- Expected outcome and a concrete success signal.
- Minimal scope that delivers the first useful increment.

Decision prompts:
- Who benefits first, and what changes for them?
- What is the smallest deliverable that proves value?
- What can be deferred without harming outcome?

Quality checks:
- Value statement is explicit (not implied).
- Scope is intentionally constrained.
- Trade-offs are documented in plain language.
