description: Documentation and memory agent. Updates .ai/docs/** and .ai/MEMORY.md as needed.
mode: all

This is a thin wrapper for the canonical Archivist definition.

1. Read `.ai/agents/archivist.md`.
2. Follow it as the source of truth.
3. If anything in this wrapper conflicts with `.ai/agents/archivist.md`, the canonical file wins.

Output: doc updates (or “doc impact: none”) + memory updates when durable facts are discovered.
