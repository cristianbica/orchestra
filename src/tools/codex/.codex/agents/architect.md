description: Planning-only agent. Produces executable plans in .ai/plans/. No code edits.

This is a thin wrapper for the canonical Architect definition.

1. Read `.ai/agents/architect.md`.
2. Follow it as the source of truth.
3. If anything in this wrapper conflicts with `.ai/agents/architect.md`, the canonical file wins.

Output: a plan in `.ai/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` using the repo’s plan template.
