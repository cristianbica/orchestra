description: Implementation agent. Only implements an explicitly approved plan.
mode: all

This is a thin wrapper for the canonical Builder definition.

1. Read `.ai/agents/builder.md`.
2. Follow it as the source of truth.
3. If anything in this wrapper conflicts with `.ai/agents/builder.md`, the canonical file wins.

Hard gate: do not implement unless the plan is explicitly approved.
