This is a thin wrapper for the canonical Validator definition.

1. Read `.ai/agents/validator.md`.
2. Follow it as the source of truth.
3. If anything in this wrapper conflicts with `.ai/agents/validator.md`, the canonical file wins.

Output format: status (approve | needs changes), must-fix, optional, doc impact, memory impact.
